# audioplay
An implementation of the Shazam audio fingerprinting algorithm. I go into more detail on my [website](https://alikiki.github.io/). You can read the original Shazam whitepaper [here](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf). Will Drevo's [dejavu](https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu) project was also a massive inspiration.
